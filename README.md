# GeoSpatial Hackathon-StartUp Challenge By IIIT-Hyderabad
Contactless Enforcement Solutions For Cycle Lanes to promote Active Mobility in India as safe as possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is the problem? Explain specifically what is being attempted.**

COVID 19 has brought about a revolution in the thinking of cities across the world to reprioritise walking and cycling for building healthier and more resilient cities.With 100 smart cities on the anvil in the country, Indian cities are only now seeing provisioning of cycling tracks. Encroachment of cycle lanes by motor vehicles is putting lives at risk and derailing the efforts towards creating safe cycling eco-system. It is important to wield disincentives to make safe cycling infrastructure work as intended.However, with the lack of understanding of the usage of the lanes since they are a brand new infrastructure, it is important to bring in enforcement as an important aspect of maintaining infrastructure that encourages people to cycle. The staffing in the police will not be able to catch up to manually enforce violations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is the solution/idea?**

Develop contact less solutions to identify violation in use of cycle lanes, capture evidence of violation (infringement by other vehicles for movement or stopping) and alert the same to concerned authorities for enforcement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**What is the technology used to solve the problem?**

Usage of computer vision, image recognition etc. can be utilised for developing a fool-proof enforcement solution. The solution should be cost effective, so that it can be scaled for use at multiple locations across a city without consuming too much resources like internet bandwidth, storage space, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**What are features built in the POC?**

The solution so developed should be able to automatically detect different forms (shapes, weight, and footprint) of cycles, including smaller cycles designed for children and distinguish from other vehicular forms like motorbikes, mopeds, scooters, etc., which are not allowed on cycle lanes. Cycles are driven at speeds ranging from 10 kmph to 60 kmph, so the solution should be able to detect cyclist travelling at any speed. The cycle lanes can be of dedicated or shared by design. On shared lanes, mixed use of cycles are other vehicle modes are allowed, however priority on such lanes shall be for cyclists, the solution should be able to detect such situations, where other vehicles fail to yield to a cyclist and capture evidence of the same for reporting. In order to ensure that the solution is configurable to meet changing policies on cycle lane use, the solution should have user interface, where authorised personnel can configure what (type of active mobility) use is legally allowed or not on cycle lanes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**What will be the key implementation steps (for the full solution)**

Usage of computer vision, image & video recognition, tracking & recognising vehicle information via FastTag RFID, etc. can be utilised for developing a fool-proof enforcement solution by installing IOT based Hardware product at every Street Light Poles. However, the solution will be cost effective, so that it can be scaled for use at multiple locations across a city without consuming too much resources like internet bandwidth, storage space, etc. There will be special Mobile App that will guide vehicle users whether to join in special shared lanes (if no cycles/public transport is there in particular stretch of road) or it can be way for faster means of commuting based on incentive engineering concept.
